To configure if you don't wish to change any defaults:
    ./waf configure

However, you may wish to install into a particular location:
    ./waf configure --prefix=/opt/hr

Now you can build once everything has been configured:
    ./waf

Finally, you can install hr if you wish:
    sudo ./waf install
